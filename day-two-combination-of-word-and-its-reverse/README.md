Write a function called `fun_with_words(word)` that takes as input a word (string) and returns a new word that is a combination of the given word and of its reverse. For example, calling `fun_with_words('TrAvElInGpRoGrAmMeR')`, one should get the following output `'TrAvElInGpRoGrAmMeRReMmArGoRpGnIlEvArT'`. If you are not a beginner, write an additional function called `fun_with_words2(word)` that does the same but also removes all vowels from the resulting string.
