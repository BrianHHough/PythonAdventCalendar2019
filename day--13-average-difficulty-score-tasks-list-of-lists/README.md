# Day 13 - Return Average Difficulty Score of Tasks - List of Lists

## Prompt

While submitting each task I ask you "how difficult was this it?" in order to adjust the difficulty level of next tasks. Write a function called get_avg_difficulty(list_of_lists) that takes as input a list of lists , for example l = [[1,0,8,4], [2, 5, 6, 2], [8,8,1,7], ..., [1,9,4,5]] where each list in l shows the difficulty scores for 1 tasks, and returns the average difficulty score given by all participants for all len(list_of_lists) tasks (as float). Assume that the length of each of the sublists is same. If you are able to (hope you are!), write an additional function called get_median_difficulty(list_of_lists) that returns the median instead of the average of the difficulty scores.
