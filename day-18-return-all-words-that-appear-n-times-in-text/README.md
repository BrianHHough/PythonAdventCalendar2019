# Day 18 - Return All of the Words that Appear 'n' Times in the Plain Text

## Prompt

Write a function called `get_top_words(plain_text, n)` that takes as input a plain text (string, lowercase, no special characters) and an integer n and returns all words that appear at least `n` times in the `plain_text` (as a sorted list). For example, calling `get_top_words("this challenge is like piece of cake for you if you like coding", 2)` we should get `["like", "you"]` since both words "you" and "like" occur at least twice in the input text.
