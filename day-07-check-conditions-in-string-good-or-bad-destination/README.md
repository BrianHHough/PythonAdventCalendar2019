# Day 7 - Check the Conditions in a String (Good or Bad Location)

## Prompt

I still haven't decided on where I should go in March and I ask you for help! Write a function called check_destination(city, avg_temp, avg_airbnb_price, time_offset) that takes as input a city (string), an average (high) temperature in March (float), an average monthly AirBnB price (float) and a time offset (int, i.e. 2 means UTC+2), and returns 'city is a good destination.', i.e. 'Warsaw is a good destination.' if a city is a good destination for me to go, and 'city is a bad destination.' i.e. 'Warsaw is a bad destination.' otherwise. Let's define what a 'good' destination is:
* The average temperature should be above 15 degrees (Celsius)
* The average monthly AirBnB price for an apartment should be max 1000 (Euros but forget about the currency)
* The time offset should be between 0 and 8, both inclusive (I hate waking up early!).

Use your function to check if ("Lisboa", 18.5, 1050.90, 0) would be a good destination for me to go (just print the result!) :)

If you are advanced, write an additional function called get_local_time(city, time_offset) that takes as arguments a city and a time offset, computes local time in given city and returns 'It is HH:MM:SS local time in city right now.'
