# Day 21 - Tell Me the Distance Between Travel Destinations

## Prompt

One of the craziest flight connections I've ever had was Berlin-Zurich-Frankfurt-Osaka-Tokyo-Vienna-Berlin. Write a function called `compute_distance(list_of_cities, distance_lookup)` that takes as input a list of cities, e.g. `['Berlin', 'Zurich', 'Frankfurt', 'Osaka', 'Tokyo','Vienna', 'Berlin']` and a distance lookup dictionary presenting the distance by plane between each pair of cities, e.g. `distances = {('Berlin', 'Zurich'): 662, ('Frankfurt', 'Zurich'): 298, ('Frankfurt', 'Osaka'): 9239, ('Osaka', 'Tokyo'): 397, ('Tokyo','Vienna'): 9131, ('Berlin', 'Vienna'): 800}`, and returns the total distance by plane on the entire route. Note that the keys (tuples) in the distances dictionary are sorted alphabetically and therefore there is, for example, no `('Zurich', 'Frankfurt')` key. Be aware that the distance lookup may contain more information than needed, e.g. an additional pair `('Berlin', 'Warsaw'): 596` which is not relevant for the list of cities given above.
