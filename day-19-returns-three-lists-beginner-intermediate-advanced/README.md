# Day 19 - Return Three Lists in Form of ([...], [...], [...])

## Prompt

Previously, we were considering a sample dictionary in the form of {'Person': python_skills}, representing Python level skills assigned to each of the participants. Let's call a person whose Python skills are 0, 1 or 2 a beginner, an intermediate a person whose skills are between 3 and 7 (including both), and anyone above that advanced. Write a function called split_participants(dictionary) that accepts as input a dictionary and returns 3 lists (in form ([...], [...], [...])):
1. beginners - showing names of those participants who are defined as beginners (e.g. ['A', 'B', 'C']),
2. intermediate - showing Python skills of those participants who are defined as intermediate (e.g. [1,2,3])
3. advanced - showing pairs ('Person': python_skills) of those participants who are defined as advanced (e.g. [('A', 1), ('B', 2), ('C',3)]).
Find **the most efficient** way to do this.
