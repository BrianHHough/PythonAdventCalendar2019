# Day 11 - Takes a List of Tuples and Returns the Average Daily Price 

## Prompt

Write a function called `compute_average_price(list_of_tuples)` that takes as input a list of tuples in form `(float, int)`, i.e. `[(469.25, 28), (32.44, 2), (35.34, 2)]` representing the price (float, 1st element of the tuple) I paid for a n-days stay (int, second element of the tuple), and returns the average daily price I paid for the accommodation rounded to two decimals.
If you are quite advanced, use numpy for that :)
