# Day 14 - Return a Personalized Message from Taking as Input a Mapping which is a Python Dictionary

## Prompt

As you might have noticed, every day I send an email with the solution of the previously submitted task to those of you who have solved it. Write a function called `send_personalized_email(mapping, email_address)` that takes as input a mapping which is a Python dictionary in the form `{'Name':'email_address'}` and an email address (string), and returns a personalized message addressed to a person with the given `email_address` in the form "Dear `'Name'`, congrats on solving the task!". For example, calling `send_personalized_email({'Magda' : 'travellingprogrammer@gmail.com', ...}, 'travellingprogrammer@gmail.com')` the function should return "Dear Magda, congrats on solving the task!".
