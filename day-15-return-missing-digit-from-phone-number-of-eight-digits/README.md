# Day 15 - Return the Missing Digit from a Phone Number of Eight Digits

## Prompt

Imagine you met a very good looking guy/girl and managed to get his/her phone number. The phone number has 9 digits but, unfortunately, one of the digits is missing since you were very nervous while writing it down. The only thing you remember is that the SUM of all 9 digits was divisible by 10 - your crush was nerdy and that's one of the things you talked about.. :) Write a function called find_missing_digit(pseudo_number) that takes as input a phone number made out of 8 digits and one 'x' (it is a string, for example '0123x1234') and returns the missing digit (as int).
