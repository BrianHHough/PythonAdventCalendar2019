# Day 10 - Return List Described by Two Conditions

## Prompt

Among the participants of this challenge there are 3 kinds of people:

a) People who follow me on Instagram to check for challenge updates and didn't want to receive daily tasks reminders,

b) People who don't follow me on Instagram but signed up for receiving daily tasks reminders

c) People who follow me on Insta AND want to receive daily emails.

Write a function called `fun_with_sets(set1, set2)` that takes as input two sets of participants' IDs: `set1` is following me on Insta, and `set2` is subscribed for getting daily reminders per email. The same participant ID could be in both sets. The function should return the total number of participants described by c) as integer.
If you are able to, do it without using the intersection function:)
