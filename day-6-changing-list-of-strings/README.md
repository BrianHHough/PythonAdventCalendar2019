# Day 6 - Taking a List of Strings & Changing the List (a bit)

## Prompt

Write a function called clean_participants_list(participants) that takes as input a list of people who are taking part in Python's Advent Calendar challenge (list of strings), changes the list a bit, and returns the second last person from it. Here is how the function should modify the list:
* First, sort it alphabetically in descending order.
* If 'Magda' is in the list, remove her, she is unfortunately cheating since she saw the questions before they were published! Such a shame... :)
* Uh, I forgot to add 'Gabby'! She couldn't sign up using the link so I added her manually... If she is not on the list yet, please add her in the second place.
Call the function giving as input the sample participants list I provided below to check how it behaves :)
