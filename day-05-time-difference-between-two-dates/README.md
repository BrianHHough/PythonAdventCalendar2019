# Day 5 - Tell Me the Time Difference Between Two Dates

## Prompt

I announced the Python's Advent Calendar challenge on Nov 28th at 14:56 CET. The deadline for signing up was Dec 1st 00:00 CET. Write a function called take_difference(datetime1, datetime2), which receives as arguments 2 `datetime.datetime` objects (assume datatime1 < datatime2) and computes the time difference between datetime2 and datetime1 in seconds (as integer). Use this function to compute how much time (in seconds) did you have for joining the challenge :) Print the result! If you are able to, write another function called take_difference2 that takes an additional argument called `unit` (str), which is 'second' per default but can also be 'hour' or 'minute', and if specified, returns the mentioned time difference in a given unit.
