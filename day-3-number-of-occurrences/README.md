# Day 3 - Tell Me the Number of Occurrences

## Prompt

Write a function called `count_letters(text, letter)`, which receives as arguments a text (string) and a letter (string), and returns the number of occurrences of the given letter (count both capital and small letters!) in the given string. For example, `count_letters('trAvelingprogrammer', 'a')` should return 2 and `count_letters('trAvelingprogrammer', 'A')` should return also 2. If you are quite advanced, use Regular Expressions or Lambda function here :)
